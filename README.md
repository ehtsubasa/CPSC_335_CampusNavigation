## Campus Map Pathfinding Visualizer

This is an academic project developed to explore graph traversal algorithms and interactive UI design in Python.  
The application visualizes pathfinding across a campus map using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm.


## 📌 Features

- Interactive map-based UI built with Tkinter
- Users can:
  - Click or input the **start** and **destination** points
  - Visualize the path using:
    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Disable nodes on the map (simulating real-life obstacles or blocked routes)
    

## 🖼️ Map Image

This application uses a campus map image as the visual base.  
Make sure the image file is kept in the project directory (do **not** remove it — the app will not run without it).


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Matplotlib (visual plotting)
- NetworkX (graph structure and pathfinding)
  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ehtsubasa/CPSC_335_CampusNavigation.git
   cd CPSC_335_CampusNavigation
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   
The GUI will launch, and you can begin selecting points or blocking nodes.


## 🧠 Educational Purpose:

This project was created as part of an academic learning initiative to deepen understanding of graph theory, pathfinding algorithms, and GUI development in Python.
